## Handwritten Digits Recognition
This project uses a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

## How to Use
You can train this neural network on any data you want, but it is currently configured to train on the dataset from the MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits:

You may encounter problems with downloading the datasets. In this case, I suggest using tools like the Wayback Machine.
Then you can draw your number or get a random number from the test dataset and check your model results.
